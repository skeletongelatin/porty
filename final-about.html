                <p class="bio-text">Hi! I'm an artist and creative producer with a strong eye for the whimsical and a focus on making work that emphasizes creativity and fun above all else. I grew up in Oakland, California and am very much a product of that richly diverse and creative cultural environment.</p>
                
                <p class="bio-text">My output spans animation, film, interactive art, live events, and digital media, often blending storytelling with hands-on experimentation and audience interaction.</p>
                
                <p class="bio-text">I've produced and hosted sold-out animated film showcases, created promotional and commercial media, and built immersive installations incorporating projection mapping, interactive audio, and physical design. Super inspired by indie comics and zines, games, bikes, bugs, and basically anything that catches my curiosity.</p>
                
                <p class="bio-text">Currently, I'm pursuing a double major in Animation and Multimedia Production while supporting others through teaching, technical assistance, and collaborative project work at PCC's Multimedia Lab and STEAM Center.</p>
                
                <p class="bio-text">Oh! I'm also an award-winning coffee roaster. Probably not super relevant, but neat!</p>
